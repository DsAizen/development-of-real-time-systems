1. What is the minimum/maximum/average response time of all tasks?
    For Task 1 :
      Minimum Response Time = 0.5
      Average Response Time = 0.5
      Maximum Response Time = 0.5
    For Task 2 :
      Minimum Response Time = 1.5
      Average Response Time = 1.84
      Maximum Response Time = 2.0
    For Task 3 :
      Minimum Response Time = 1.0
      Average Response Time = 1.9
      Maximum Response Time = 3.0

2. Is any task missing the deadline? Which task? Where?
    None of the periodic task miss deadline. But Task 4, Sporadic Task misses
      deadline at time 80.

3. Is the sporadic job meeting its deadline?
    No. Sporadic job misses deadline.

4. What is the response time for the sporadic job?
    Response time for sporadic job is 30. i.e., it starts at time 50 and ends
      at time 80.

5. Which scheduler is better is better in this example; EDF or RM?
    In this case EDF scheduler is better, because with this scheduler sporadic
      task does not miss deadline.
